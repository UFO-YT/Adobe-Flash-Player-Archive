                    You may have heard that Flash Player is very insecure and that having it poses a huge secuirty threat to yourself. This is true for the browser plugin version of Adobe Flash Player. However, this version of Adobe Flash Player is the local desktop application version. Meaning, that it is safe.

                    All files on this page were taken from the Internet Archive. Who then, in turn, got those files from Adobe's official archive page for Flash Player. All files on this site are un edited meaning that they originate untouched from Adobe's own official website. If you do not trust this site then feel free to refrence the Internet Archive version and thus the archived version of Adobe's own official website.

                    What is Adobe Flash Player?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adobe Flash Player is a browser plugin and desktop application that runs interactive webpages, Rich Internet Applications, video games, cartoons, and other interactive content targeted for it. Using the ActionScript programming language, Flash content created in Flash Professional and Flash Builder are then exported in the Shockwave Flash (.swf) file format. .swf files are then able to be used via Adobe Flash Player. If you find a .swf file on your computer or the web, then you are going to need Adobe Flash Player to run it.

                <p>
                    For a very long time, from around the late 90s to the mid 2010s, Flash Player was used across the entire internet. Over 90% of desktop users had Adobe Flash Player installed then and most interactive content on the web used it. For example, there may be some video games that you are familiar with that use Flash Player to run. In 2020 Adobe officially ended support for Flash Player and all major browsers prevented users from using it. Today almost no websites use Flash content any more. This is a stark contrast to before when the majority of the web had used Flash content. <br><br> Adobe Flash Player lifespan: <br> 1996 - 2020
